# Imperative Code
A lot of JavaScript is imperative code. If you don't know what "imperative" means here, then you might be scratching your head a bit. According to the dictionary, "imperative" means:

expressing a command; commanding
When JavaScript code is written imperatively, we tell JavaScript exactly what to do and how to do it. Think of it as if we're giving JavaScript commands on exactly what steps it should take. For example, I give you the humble for loop:

const people = ['Amanda', 'Geoff', 'Michael', 'Richard', 'Ryan', 'Tyler']
const excitedPeople = []

for (let i = 0; i < people.length; i++) {
  excitedPeople[i] = people[i] + '!'
}
If you've worked with JavaScript any length of time, then this should be pretty straightforward. We're looping through each item in the people array, adding an exclamation mark to their name, and storing the new string in the excitedPeople array. Pretty simple, right?

This is imperative code, though. We're commanding JavaScript what to do at every single step. We have to give it commands to:

set an initial value for the iterator - (let i = 0)
tell the for loop when it needs to stop - (i < people.length)
get the person at the current position and add an exclamation mark - (people[i] + '!')
store the data in the ith position in the other array - (excitedPeople[i])
increment the i variable by one - (i++)
Remember the example of keeping the air temperature at 71ยบ? In my old car, I would turn the knob to get the cold air flowing. But if it got too cold, then I'd turn the knob up higher. Eventually, it would get too warm, and I'd have to turn the knob down a bit, again. I'd have to manage the temperature myself with every little change. Doesn't this sound like an imperative situation to you? I have to manually do multiple steps. It's not ideal, so let's improve things!

## Declarative Code
In contrast to imperative code, we've got declarative code. With declarative code, we don't code up all of the steps to get us to the end result. Instead, we declare what we want done, and JavaScript will take care of doing it. This explanation is a bit abstract, so let's look at an example. Let's take the imperative for loop code we were just looking at and refactor it to be more declarative.

With the imperative code we were performing all of the steps to get to the end result. What is the end result that we actually want, though? Well, our starting point was just an array of names:

const people = ['Amanda', 'Geoff', 'Michael', 'Richard', 'Ryan', 'Tyler']
The end goal that we want is an array of the same names but where each name ends with an exclamation mark:

["Amanda!", "Geoff!", "Michael!", "Richard!", "Ryan!", "Tyler!"]
To get us from the starting point to the end, we'll just use JavaScript's .map() function to declare what we want done.

const excitedPeople = people.map(name => name + '!')
That's it! Notice that with this code we haven't:

created an iterator object
told the code when it should stop running
used the iterator to access a specific item in the people array
stored each new string in the excitedPeople array
...all of those steps are taken care of by JavaScript's .map() Array method.

### ex.
const people = ['Amanda', 'Geoff', 'Michael', 'Richard', 'Ryan', 'Tyler']
const longNames = people.filter(name => name.length > 6)

result: ["Michael", "Richard"]
