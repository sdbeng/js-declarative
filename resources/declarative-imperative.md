# Imperative Code
A lot of JavaScript is imperative code. If you don't know what "imperative" means here, then you might be scratching your head a bit. According to the dictionary, "imperative" means:

expressing a command; commanding
When JavaScript code is written imperatively, we tell JavaScript exactly what to do and how to do it. Think of it as if we're giving JavaScript commands on exactly what steps it should take. For example, I give you the humble for loop:

const people = ['Amanda', 'Geoff', 'Michael', 'Richard', 'Ryan', 'Tyler']
const excitedPeople = []

for (let i = 0; i < people.length; i++) {
  excitedPeople[i] = people[i] + '!'
}
If you've worked with JavaScript any length of time, then this should be pretty straightforward. We're looping through each item in the people array, adding an exclamation mark to their name, and storing the new string in the excitedPeople array. Pretty simple, right?

This is imperative code, though. We're commanding JavaScript what to do at every single step. We have to give it commands to:

set an initial value for the iterator - (let i = 0)
tell the for loop when it needs to stop - (i < people.length)
get the person at the current position and add an exclamation mark - (people[i] + '!')
store the data in the ith position in the other array - (excitedPeople[i])
increment the i variable by one - (i++)
Remember the example of keeping the air temperature at 71ยบ? In my old car, I would turn the knob to get the cold air flowing. But if it got too cold, then I'd turn the knob up higher. Eventually, it would get too warm, and I'd have to turn the knob down a bit, again. I'd have to manage the temperature myself with every little change. Doesn't this sound like an imperative situation to you? I have to manually do multiple steps. It's not ideal, so let's improve things!

## Declarative Code
In contrast to imperative code, we've got declarative code. With declarative code, we don't code up all of the steps to get us to the end result. Instead, we declare what we want done, and JavaScript will take care of doing it. This explanation is a bit abstract, so let's look at an example. Let's take the imperative for loop code we were just looking at and refactor it to be more declarative.

With the imperative code we were performing all of the steps to get to the end result. What is the end result that we actually want, though? Well, our starting point was just an array of names:

const people = ['Amanda', 'Geoff', 'Michael', 'Richard', 'Ryan', 'Tyler']
The end goal that we want is an array of the same names but where each name ends with an exclamation mark:

["Amanda!", "Geoff!", "Michael!", "Richard!", "Ryan!", "Tyler!"]
To get us from the starting point to the end, we'll just use JavaScript's .map() function to declare what we want done.

const excitedPeople = people.map(name => name + '!')
That's it! Notice that with this code we haven't:

created an iterator object
told the code when it should stop running
used the iterator to access a specific item in the people array
stored each new string in the excitedPeople array
...all of those steps are taken care of by JavaScript's .map() Array method.

### ex.
const people = ['Amanda', 'Geoff', 'Michael', 'Richard', 'Ryan', 'Tyler']
const longNames = people.filter(name => name.length > 6)

result: ["Michael", "Richard"]

## React Is Declarative
We'll get to writing React code very soon, but let's take another glimpse at it to show how it's declarative.

<button onClick={activateTeleporter}>Activate Teleporter</button>
It might seem odd, but this is valid React code and should be pretty easy to understand. Notice that there's just an onClick attribute on the button...we aren't using .addEventListener() to set up event handling with all of the steps involved to set it up. Instead, we're just declaring that we want the activateTeleporter function to run when the button is clicked.
Declarative Code Recap
Imperative code instructs JavaScript on how it should perform each step. With declarative code, we tell JavaScript what we want to be done, and let JavaScript take care of performing the steps.

React is declarative because we write the code that we want, and React is in charge of taking our declared code and performing all of the JavaScript/DOM steps to get us to our desired result.

## Unidirectional Data Flow
Data-Binding In Other Frameworks
Front-end frameworks like Angular and Ember make use of two-way data bindings. In two-way data binding, the data is kept in sync throughout the app no matter where it is updated. If a model changes the data, then the data updates in the view. Alternatively, if the user changes the data in the view, then the data is updated in the model. Two-way data binding sounds really powerful, but it can make the application harder to reason about and know where the data is actually being updated.

### React's Data-flow
Data moves differently with React's unidirectional data flow. In React, the data flows from the parent component to a child component.

Parent Component -> Child Component
Data flows down from parent component to child component. Data updates are sent to the parent component where the parent performs the actual change.
In the image above, we have two components:

* a parent component
* a child component

The data lives in the parent component and is passed down to the child component. Even though the data lives in the parent component, Both the parent and the child components can use the data. However, if the data must be updated, then only the parent component should perform the update. If the child component needs to make a change to the data, then it would send the updated data to the parent component where the change will actually be made. Once the change is made in the parent component, the child component will be passed the data (that has just been updated!).
Now, this might seem like extra work, but having the data flow in one direction and having one place where the data is modified makes it much easier to understand how the application works.

## Q:A FlightPlanner component stores the information for booking a flight. It also contains DatePicker and DestinationPicker as child components. Here's what the code might look like:

<FlightPlanner>
  <DatePicker />
  <DestinationPicker />
</FlightPlanner>

f this were a React application, which component(s) should be in charge of making updates to the data? Check all that apply.
result: FlightPlanner

* Since FlightPlanner is the parent component and stores the data, any changes to the data should be made by this component.


## If the following sample code were a React application, which of the following components should be in charge of making updates to the data? Check all that apply.

<FlightPlanner>

  <LocationPicker>
    <OriginPicker />
    <DestinationPicker />
  </LocationPicker>

  <DatePicker />

</FlightPlanner>

Result:
FlightPlanner and LocationPicker

* The component that stores the data should be the one that updates de data.

## Data-flow In React Recap
In React, data flows in only one direction, from parent to child. If data is shared between sibling child components, then the data should be stored in the parent component and passed to both of the child components that need it.
